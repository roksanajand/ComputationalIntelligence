## Fuzzy Logic Production Advisor

This project implements a fuzzy logic-based decision support system for determining whether to increase, decrease, or maintain the production level of a product. The system uses three input variables — market demand, inventory level, and unit production cost — and outputs a production recommendation. The fuzzy inference is based on 60 rules and supports multiple defuzzification methods for result interpretation.


## Genetic Algorithm – Traveling Salesman Problem

This project implements a Genetic Algorithm to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). It simulates the evolution of routes using selection, crossover, and mutation to minimize the total travel distance. The algorithm supports different selection methods (ranking, roulette), succession strategies (full, partial, elitism), and allows parameter tuning. Visualizations of routes and performance metrics across generations are included for analysis and comparison.
