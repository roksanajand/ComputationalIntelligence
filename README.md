## Fuzzy Logic Production Advisor

This project implements a fuzzy logic-based decision support system for determining whether to increase, decrease, or maintain the production level of a product. The system uses three input variables — market demand, inventory level, and unit production cost — and outputs a production recommendation. The fuzzy inference is based on 60 rules and supports multiple defuzzification methods for result interpretation.


## Genetic Algorithm – Traveling Salesman Problem

This project implements a Genetic Algorithm to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). It simulates the evolution of routes using selection, crossover, and mutation to minimize the total travel distance. The algorithm supports different selection methods (ranking, roulette), succession strategies (full, partial, elitism), and allows parameter tuning. Visualizations of routes and performance metrics across generations are included for analysis and comparison.

## Monte Carlo π Estimation

This project demonstrates how to estimate the value of π using the Monte Carlo method. It simulates random points in a unit square and checks how many fall inside a quarter circle to approximate π. The project includes visualizations of point distributions, running estimates, histograms, and boxplots for different sample sizes and repetitions.

## SSN 

This project explores how the structure and training process of a simple feedforward neural network (MLP) affects its ability to approximate a nonlinear function.
We investigate the impact of:

- The number of neurons in the hidden layer

- The number of hidden layers

- The size of the training set

- The number of training epochs

- The Early Stopping mechanism

We analyze underfitting, overfitting, and the generalization ability of the network using MSE metrics and visualizations of training, validation, and test errors.
The experiments are based on the approximation of a nonlinear, noisy function.
