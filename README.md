## Fuzzy Logic Production Advisor

This project implements a fuzzy logic-based decision support system for determining whether to increase, decrease, or maintain the production level of a product. The system uses three input variables — market demand, inventory level, and unit production cost — and outputs a production recommendation. The fuzzy inference is based on 60 rules and supports multiple defuzzification methods for result interpretation.
